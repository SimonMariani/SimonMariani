# Introduction
This is the github of the personal website from Simon Mariani, as of now it contains the general information you would find on a CV, and a chatbot that has been
trained to answer questions about Simon Mariani.


# TODO
- add links to home for companies and papers and such
- extend projects page with projects including this one
- update the chatbot with more files and make sure it knows that not everything is direct information but also projects
- add file upload extenstion but this requires some form of authentication but you can implement it just on that password so that you can still easily add
a password or something so it shouldn't be that hard
- ssl
- update domain name once it is ready
